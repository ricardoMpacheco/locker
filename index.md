## Ricardo's Script Locker

This page is used for easy access to all the scripts I have put together.

### [SaRA Command-Line Version](https://github.com/ricardoMpacheco/SaRACMDScript)

[Download here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardoMpacheco/SaRACMDScript/main/SaRACMDScript.ps1)

### [Outlook Network Tests](https://github.com/ricardoMpacheco/ONT)
The script can be easily accessed / run by running the following powershell cmdlets:

$ONTScript = Invoke-WebRequest https://aka.ms/ONT

Invoke-Expression $($ONTScript.Content)

or by <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardoMpacheco/ONT/master/ONT.ps1" download>Downloading it directly!</a>
